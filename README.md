## Introduction
Are you waiting for Diablo II Remastered? I don't, thanks for asking.  
BUT, Diablo II is one of my favorite games of all time, and so I decided to make something Diablo II related in WoW universe.

---------------------------------------
## Runeword Master?
Never farmed tower? No worries, now you'll know what it is, in a bad way, too.

### Concept
The whole idea is built around runes and runewords.  
In addition to normal abilities and mechanics, every so often boss will make players draw a rune, and will receive an effect based on result.

### But Why Runeword Master?
Because not only boss will benefit and players will suffer from rune effect(s), but also if you are very unlucky, rolled runes will make a runeword, and that **may** be a big problem for you.

### Technical Side
- A dungeon boss  
- Not soloable  
- All runes and runewords are taken straight from Diablo II  
- Effects are converted from Diablo II where possible including numerous new mechanics such as Brushing Blow and others  
- Over 100 new spells total  
- Using entries **500000+** in **Spell.dbc**, **SpellIcon.dbc**, `creature_template`, `creature_equip_template`, `creature_text`  
- Expected client locale: **enGB**  
- For script: you can either use patch or add script file manually  
- For sql: there is a single sql file you need to apply to your `world` DB. You'll have it in your `/sql/custom_runeworder/` folder  
- For dbc: you can use included full 3.3.5 dbc's or apply provided patch. Patch is created using **MyDbc Editor ver. 1.2.2**

### Other Info
Included boss entity: 'Duchess' <Mistress of Runes> is a upgraded version of Countess, which only dies miserably and drop runes.  
Used model is one of Sylvanas early test elf models.
